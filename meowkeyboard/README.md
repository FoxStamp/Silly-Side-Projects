## How to use

### Step 1: Download the Project

1. On the repository page, locate and click on the green "Code" button.
2. In the dropdown menu, click on "Download ZIP." This will download a compressed ZIP file containing the entire project to your computer.
3. Once the download is complete, locate the downloaded ZIP file (usually in your computer's "Downloads" folder) and extract its contents to a location of your choice. You can right-click on the ZIP file and select "Extract All..." to do this.

### Step 2: Install Python (if not already installed)

1. If you don't have Python installed on your computer, you'll need to download and install it. Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to get the latest version.
2. Download the Python installer for your operating system and run it.
3. In the installer, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python X.Y to PATH" (where X.Y represents the version number). This ensures that Python is added to your system's PATH environment variable, allowing you to run Python from the command line.
4. Complete the installation by following the on-screen instructions.

### Step 3: Run the Application (method 1)

1. Open the extracted "meowkeyboard" folder that you obtained from the ZIP file.
2. Inside the folder, you should see a subdirectory named "dist." Open this directory.
3. Look for a file named "meowboardInterface.exe" and double-click on it to launch the application.
4. (Optional) If you want easy access you can make a shortcut for this file so you can access it from your desktop

### Step 3: Run the Application (method 2 (windows only))

1. Open your command prompt and navigate to the project
2. For example if the project is located at C:\Users\tiramisu\Desktop\meowkeyboard\ and you were at C:\Users\tiramisu you would input
```
cd desktop\meowkeyboard
```
2. You could also use the full file path as well like 
```
cd C:\Users\tiramisu\Desktop\Silly-Side-Projects\meowkeyboard
```
3. Once there, run:
```
dist\meowboardInterface.exe
```

Congratulations! You are a proud new owner of the meowkeyboard :3
